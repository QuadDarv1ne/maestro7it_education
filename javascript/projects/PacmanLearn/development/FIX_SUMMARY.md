# Fix for Pacman Modular Version Buttons

## Issue
The `development/pacman_modular.html` file was not working because it was missing the JavaScript code that handles button events and initializes the game.

## Root Cause
The HTML file had all the necessary UI elements and button elements, but it was missing the JavaScript section that:
1. Initializes the PacmanGame object
2. Adds event listeners to all buttons
3. Handles user interactions with the menu system

## Solution
Added the missing JavaScript code at the end of the file that includes:

### 1. Game Initialization
- Creates a global `game` variable to hold the PacmanGame instance
- Initializes the game when the window loads
- Sets up all necessary event handlers

### 2. Button Event Handlers
Added event listeners for all buttons in the interface:
- Main menu buttons (Play, Level Select, Settings, High Scores, About)
- Back buttons for each screen
- Settings save button
- In-game control buttons (Start, Pause, Reset, Menu)
- Message dialog button

### 3. Additional Functionality
- Slider input handler for game speed setting
- Proper sound effects for all button clicks
- Integration with the existing PacmanGame.js class

## Files Modified
- `development/pacman_modular.html` - Added the missing JavaScript section

## Testing
Created and ran a test script that verified all 14 button handlers were properly added to the HTML file.

## Result
The modular version of the Pacman game now has fully functional buttons and menu navigation, just like the main `pacman_enhanced.html` version. Users can now:
- Navigate between different screens
- Start and control the game
- Access settings and high scores
- Select levels
- Return to the main menu
